# Modern page header configurator and custom property pane color picker control built in React

## Summary
A web part to be added to modern site pages to allow configuration of the page banner. The web part allows you to pick the banner size or hide it, override the default background graphics, and change the page headline color.

*Note: This web part injects CSS into the page to override the default CSS provided by a modern page. If the default CSS changes, this web part will no longer work. It is the wish of the author that Microsoft adds this capability as part of a modern page.*
